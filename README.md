# Anagram-Generator
This project generates valid anagrams for input words using a Trie data structure for efficient dictionary lookups. It was implemented in Java.

## Features
- Generates all valid anagrams for given input words.
- Uses a dictionary to validate word combinations.
- Measures runtime for performance evaluation.

## How to Run
1. Compile the Java files using `javac *.java`.
2. Provide the input file as a command-line argument: `java Assig4 <inputFile>`.
3. Ensure the dictionary file (`dictionary.txt`) is in the same directory.

## Files
- `Assig4.java`: Main program logic.
- `Phrase.java`: Represents phrases with multiple words.
- `TrieSTNew.java`: Trie data structure for efficient dictionary operations.
- `TrieSTTest.java`: Test cases for the Trie.

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher.
- `dictionary.txt` file containing valid words.
